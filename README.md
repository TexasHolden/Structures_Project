# Description: For the Structures Project, we were given the choice of one problem to code in two different languages using two programming paradigms. 
The directions given are as follows:

"If you choose to code, you will write small code that displays the major difference between two
languages in two different paradigms. The codes should be well commented. Comment effectively so that it is easier to
understand. For each concept, include a description."

I chose to create a program that can tell if a string is a palindrome or not in C++ (using object oriented programming) and Python (using functional programming).

# Concepts: Since the concepts are seperated into parts on each file, here are the concepts all in one area for easier reading:

Concept 1 ~The need for main()~ : C++ NEEDS a main, or what we'll call an entry point. Programs in c++ just need an entry point it can direct it around with function calls (and ect.) until main has ended. Unlike the c++ code, main is no where in sight. This is because python doesn't need one, for the Python interpreter from the top of the file unless a specific function is defined.

Concept 2 ~Compilers and Interpreters~ : C++ uses a compiler while python uses interpreters. Compilers take high level programs and convert them into machine code which is saved as an executable on a disk and then the user can runt it as a.out. Python doesn't have a compiler like c++. Instead, is uses an application called an interpreter. The interpreter compiles and executes the code without storing the machine code being created.

Concept 3 ~The use of types~: C++ constantly uses types, it being a statically-typed language, making types a highly important part of C++. Everything (variables, function arguement, function return values) need a type to be compiled. This is important for memory, for what type determines the amount of memory it needs allocated. Python doesn't use types because it's highly dynamic. The Interpreter can't figure out the type of anything without executing the program, which defeats the purpose of Python being highly dynamic.
